## [Overview](https://uzm-dr-yunusemrebaysal.netlify.app/)

The Yunus Emre Baysal Children's Clinic website was designed to create a trustworthy and welcoming online presence for a pediatric clinic. Built with performance, accessibility, and ease of use in mind, the website leverages Next.js for the front-end and TypeScript for a reliable, maintainable codebase. A strong emphasis was placed on mobile responsiveness and SEO optimization to ensure that families can easily find and access the clinic's services.

## Key Features

- **Responsive Design**: Developed with Tailwind CSS to ensure optimal display across all devices, from smartphones to desktops, offering a seamless experience for parents seeking medical services.
- **SEO Optimization**: Implemented server-side rendering and dynamic metadata handling to maximize visibility in search engines, critical for local clinics.
- **High Performance**: Optimized loading speeds and image delivery to provide a fast, smooth browsing experience, particularly on mobile networks.
- **Accessibility**: Followed best practices to ensure the website is accessible to users with disabilities, aligning with modern web standards.
- **Easy Content Management**: Structured the project to allow future content updates (such as doctor bios, service descriptions, and announcements) with minimal technical effort.
- **Secure Hosting**: Deployed the site on a secure, reliable hosting platform ensuring data privacy and protection.

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js**: For server-side and client-side rendering capabilities
- **TypeScript**: For type safety across the entire codebase
- **Tailwind CSS**: For rapid UI development and responsive design
- **Vercel**: For deployment with automatic scaling and HTTPS encryption
- **SEO Best Practices**: For better search engine ranking and local discoverability

## Challenges and Learnings

A major challenge was balancing high visual quality (especially for images and branding elements) with fast page load times on slower mobile networks. Image optimization strategies, careful asset management, and smart use of lazy loading were critical in addressing this.

Additionally, making the site fully accessible according to WCAG standards required attention to detail in color contrasts, keyboard navigation, and screen reader support, deepening expertise in building inclusive web applications.

## Outcome

The Yunus Emre Baysal Children's Clinic website successfully launched, providing a fast, secure, and family-friendly digital platform. Page load times are consistently under 1.5 seconds, and initial SEO metrics show strong improvements in local search visibility.

The project highlights how modern frontend technologies, when paired with strong design and accessibility principles, can deliver significant value for small businesses and healthcare professionals alike.
